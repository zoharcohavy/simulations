# 5 Files total all .html files that can be opened on a google chrome browser

doubleslit_-onlyinner: this file shows the inner 2 surfaces in the experiment, these surfaces produce a stretched out pattern on the screen/wall

doubleslit_-onlyouter: Shows the outer 2 surfaces in the experiment, they produce a compressed resulted pattern on the screen/wall
  doubleslit_-onlyon: --\ these 2 are just the on and off versions of the outer surface pattern in case its too hard to see anything in 'onlyouter'
  doubleslit_-onlyoff:--/ you can mess around with all the different versions and alter the code to get the results you want. 
  
doubleslit_-innerandouter: combines all into one but this file is pretty difficult to pay attention to which is why the previous files are used to 
break things down.
