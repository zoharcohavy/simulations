# simulations
Ok theres a lot of files here. 

Youre probably going to want orbits.html which is just the best gravity simulation I have so far

Theres a few other interesting ones.

The deal is still up.. Whoever pushes 2d magnets simulation that actually works will have their name on the upper right corner of the simulation on this repository (forever and ever). My name is on the gravity simulation already, so I got to do the easy job lol. 

If no one gets 2d magnets, im gonna eventually just do it myself.
