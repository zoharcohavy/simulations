# simulations

Magnetism (250 lines) - best magnetism simulation so far!

Orbits (158 lines) - Best gravity simulation I have so far

Feynman files - Some simple mechanical stuff I used in my feynman vid

    Feynman.html (135 lines)
    Feynman_absorptions (129 lines)
    Feynman_expulsions (136 lines)

Grav_absorbing (174 lines) - Another gravity simulation with 2 directions only

Parkour Physics (232 lines) - This one is for a scene used in this video

Light (107 lines) - Crude implementation for light. 
Update: it is claimed to be blue force (electron force) only. I agree with the claim but still thinking about it.

Come to the discord any time I can teach you how magnets work and you can try and simulate it yourself.
and if you do please share it with me first.
