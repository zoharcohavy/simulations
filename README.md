# simulations
Currently I only have one file, feel free to attempt to work on a 2d model of a magnet. Should be somewhat doable. 

The orbits.html file simply prints a big immovable ball, and a small moveable ball, and a finite set of force bits. The small ball is
set in the right trajectory to get a decent glimpse of the orbit function at work here.
