# simulations
Orbits.html (158 lines) - Best gravity simulation I have so far

Feynman files - Some simple mechanical stuff I used in my feynman vid

    Feynman.html (135 lines)
    Feynman_absorptions (129 lines)
    Feynman_expulsions (136 lines)

Grav_absorbing (174 lines) - Another gravity simulation but the balls only move up and down (the y-axis)

Parkour Physics (232 lines) - This one is for a scene used in this video

Light_ligit (107 lines) - Crude implementation for light, missing several details

Come to the discord any time I can teach you how magnets work and you can try and simulate it yourself.
Unfortunately I cant pay you for it..

MY teacher at smc (santa monica college) scared me when he told me theres programs with millions of
lines. Good thing I know my physics, mwahaha.

All credit so far goes to all my teachers in smc and UCLA, so many amazing teachers.
I will mention my highschool teacher Alec Gomez, who once told me "math is sexy". Something I really needed
to hear at the time (I think I was in 10th grade when I was just starting to realize how sexy this shit really
is). He also taught me a ton of math.

And heres the rest of them
Kwun Heung Cheung (smc) - Taught me everything I know about newtonian physics

gary inmendham (youtube) - Taught me a ton of philosophy, how to enjoy art, why I shouldn't kill myself, pretty
much all the force bit theory, 2+2+2 is too complex for my weak and feeble mind.

Philosophy: https://www.youtube.com/user/graytaich0

BEWARE: Philosophy is not for anyone under the age of 18. Some people might not be able to handle it at age 21,
like me. Dont say I didn't warn ya.

Paul Eggert (UCLA) - Taught me a solid amount of cs

Michael stevens, vsauce (youtube) - Mostly got me into the pursuit of knowledge, made awesome videos, was a nice guy,
and he even came back after all that and did some amazing shit with mindfield

Adam, psychedsubstance (youtube) - Taught me about safe usage of psychedelics

Professor Dekhoda (smc) - Taught me some good ole C programming (the basics)

Professor Linda Janakos (smc) - Taught me about feminism and some other good stuff ethically speaking (also taught
me about how we all view the world through a different lens)

Vasilescu, M.O. - Taught me how to make a scene in a simulation.

Sherstov, A. (UCLA) - Taught me how simple computer science can be

Darwiche, A.Y. (UCLA) - I loved the knowledge I gained in this class, but not much of it was useful for these physics simulations

Greenberg, G.J. (UCLA) - Taught me some real nice philosophy

Andrew flynn (UCLA) - Taught me i need to calm down sometimes (in a nice way), and also we talked lots of philosophy

Last but definetely not least, Moya Mazorow (SMC) - Taught me some mathematical proof stuff. But more importantly, set theory.

And finally, would like to thank some of my friends who I worked with, well, its not like they helped me that much but I 
really did need someones company, so thank you Catalina, Angel the Hyrax whisperer, Perla, and Roman for being my friends.

And finally finally, my jiu jitsu instructors, Alex, Royce, and Kris. Mostly Alex because he mentioned tool to me and then got
me into playing guitar. Which helped me a ton in summer (2019) of my life because I got to smoke weed and play guitar every day. 
Its weird because I was suffering quite a bit of depression at the time and could barely get myself to the jiu jitsu mat. Every
moment of existence at the time was just the worst kind of torture for me, but at least I got to forget all that for 5 minutes
while I was rolling. 

And thanks wendell for being nice to me when I showed you one of the first simulations I made. Showing people my work would have
been so much easier if people were more like you.
