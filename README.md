# simulations
Orbits.html (158 lines) - Best gravity simulation I have so far

Feynman files - Some simple mechanical stuff I used in my feynman vid

    Feynman.html (135 lines)
    Feynman_absorptions (129 lines)
    Feynman_expulsions (136 lines)

Grav_absorbing (174 lines) - Another gravity simulation but the balls only move up and down (the y-axis)

Parkour Physics (232 lines) - This one is for a scene used in this video

Come to the discord any time I can teach you how magnets work and you can try and simulate it yourself.
Unfortunately I cant pay you for it..

MY teacher at smc (santa monica college) scared me when he told me theres programs with millions of
lines. Good thing I know my physics, mwahaha.

All credit so far goes to all my teachers in smc and UCLA, so many amazing teachers
I will mention my highschool teacher Alec Gomez, who once told me "math is sexy". Something I really needed
to hear at the time (I think I was in 10th grade when I was just starting to realize how sexy this shit really
is). He also taught me a ton of math.

Ok I guess Ill also give credit to the rest of them
Kwun Heung Cheung (smc) - Taught me everything I know about physics
Professor Eggert (UCLA) - Taught me a solid amount of cs
Professor Dekhoda (smc) - Taught me some good ole C programming (the basics)
Professor Linda Janakos (smc) - Taught me about feminism and some other good stuff ethically speaking (also taught
me about how we all view the world through a different lens)
My computer graphics teacher (dude i suck with names) - Taught me how to make a scene.
