# simulations
Orbits.html (158 lines) - Best gravity simulation I have so far

Feynman files - Some simple mechanical stuff I used in my feynman vid

    Feynman.html (135 lines)
    Feynman_absorptions (129 lines)
    Feynman_expulsions (136 lines)

Grav_absorbing (174 lines) - Another gravity simulation but the balls only move up and down (the y-axis)

Parkour Physics (232 lines) - This one is for a scene used in this video

Come to the discord any time I can teach you how magnets work and you can try and simulate it yourself.
Unfortunately I cant pay you for it..

MY teacher at smc (santa monica college) scared me when he told me theres programs with millions of
lines. Good thing I know my physics, mwahaha.

All credit so far goes to all my teachers in smc and UCLA, so many amazing teachers
I will mention my highschool teacher Alec Gomez, who once told me "math is sexy". Something I really needed
to hear at the time (I think I was in 10th grade when I was just starting to realize how sexy this shit really
is). He also taught me a ton of math.

And heres the rest of them
Kwun Heung Cheung (smc) - Taught me everything I know about newtonian physics
gary inmendham (youtube) - Taught me a ton of philosophy, how to enjoy art, why I shouldn't kill myself, pretty
much all the force bit theory, 2+2+2 is too complex for my weak and feeble mind.

Philosophy: https://www.youtube.com/user/graytaich0
BEWARE: Philosophy is not for anyone under the age of 18. Some people might not be able to handle it at age 21,
like me. Dont say I didn't warn ya.
Paul Eggert (UCLA) - Taught me a solid amount of cs
Michael stevens, vsauce (youtube) - Mostly got me into the pursuit of knowledge, made awesome videos, was a nice guy,
and he even came back after all that and did some amazing shit with mindfield

Adam, psychedsubstance (youtube) - Taught me about safe usage of psychedelics
Professor Dekhoda (smc) - Taught me some good ole C programming (the basics)
Professor Linda Janakos (smc) - Taught me about feminism and some other good stuff ethically speaking (also taught
me about how we all view the world through a different lens)
Vasilescu, M.O. - Taught me how to make a scene in a simulation.
Sherstov, A. (UCLA) - Taught me how simple computer science can be
Darwiche, A.Y. (UCLA) - I loved the knowledge I gained in this class, but not much of it was useful for these physics simulations
Greenberg, G.J. (UCLA) - Taught me some real nice philosophy
Andrew flynn (UCLA) - Taught me i need to calm down sometimes, and also we talked lots of philosophy
Last but definetely not least, Moya Mazorow (SMC) - Taught me... well, I had no idea what she was saying half the time, but
it was fun, and she was the best math teacher I had because she was good at grading. She was actually perfect at grading,
other teachers in the math department need to learn from her *cough *cough. Sorry, something got stuck in my throat. 
Zhang, L. (UCLA) - Not sure what she taught me, I thought she was messing with me the whole time and im only like 3 weeks
into her class so far, haha.

And finally, would like to thank some of my friends who I worked with, well, its not like they helped me that much but I 
really did need someones company, so thank you Catalina, Angel the Hyrax whisperer, and Perla, for being my friends.
