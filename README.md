# simulations
Ok theres a lot of files here. 

Youre probably going to want orbits.html which is just the best gravity simulation I have so far

The orbits.html file is the only one where im promising theres nothing weird in the code. I havent proofread everything else lol.

Theres a few other interesting ones.

The deal is still up.. Whoever pushes 2d magnets simulation that actually works can get credit somewhere.
