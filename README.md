Come to the discord any time I can teach you how magnets work and you can try and simulate it yourself.

gary inmendham (youtube) - Taught me a ton of philosophy, how to enjoy art, why I shouldn't kill myself, pretty

BEWARE: Philosophy is not for anyone under the age of 18. Some people might not be able to handle it at age 21,
like me. Dont say I didn't warn you
