singleslit_-alldegrees: The single slit experiment with all degrees shown, just like in the youtube video.

singleslit: by letting the force bits go in all directions, we can see the pattern occuring more gradually
but this file is bad and should not be used for explaining the experiment in my opinion.

singleslit_-only_middle: this is the one that just shows the force bits going through the middle, so no
scatter. causes a bright spot in the center of the pattern.
